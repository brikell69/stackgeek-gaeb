# StackGeek Website in a Box
This is the production code running on http://stackgeek.com/.  

StackGeek provides a community contributed blog for discussing infrastructure architecture, managment and monitoring.  The site and posts are 100% Open Source.  Posts are stored as Gists in user's accounts, and can be forked in a similar way you fork and modify source code.

## Google AppEngine Boilerplate
The site is built using the GAEB project hosted on Github: http://github.com/gae-boilerplate.  Any modifications made to the StackGeek site which are core to the project should be submitted to GAEB directly for pull requests.

##More to come...
I'll add more here as we go on.  Instructions, etc.
